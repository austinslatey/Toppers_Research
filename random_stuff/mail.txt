Gimena,
You should have access to NetSuite now and should have gotten an email to set up your password (production)
Our product list is extensive, so it would be ideal to have our folder structure sorted by Vendor

Currently, a folder inside of our NetSuite folder system (File Cabinet > Vendor Files) which contains a series of Vendor-Named Folders. 
Within the Vendor-Named folders, a series of product-sku named folders contain publicly accessible images. 
Naming Conventions of the images don't necessiarily follow a strict pattern, besides the image name starting with the product SKU and are ordered numerically besides the main image.

Generally, the product's images names follow a relative structure of:
/VendorFiles/FirstExampleVendorName/
- 10001_main.jpg
- 10001_1.jpg
- 10001_2.jpg

If the images' naming convention needs to follow a strict pattern to have the script accept them, please let us know, and moving forward we will begin to name all images as such.

Variations of the generic product's image naming conventions can include but are not limited to:
- 10001_ExampleVendorName_main.jpg
- 10001_ExampleVendorName_1.jpg
- 10001_ExampleVendorName_2.jpg
| --------- OTHER VARIATION --------- |
- 10001_ExampleVendorName_Waldoch_main.jpg
- 10001_ExampleVendorName_Waldoch_1.jpg
- 10001_ExampleVendorName_Waldoch_2.jpg
| --------- OTHER VARIATION --------- |
- 10001.jpg
- 10001_1.jpg
- 10001_2.jpg


Regarding scripting, it should be easy enough to iterate through the image names
`[[10001_main.jpg, 10001_1.jpg, 10001_2.jpg], [0, 1, 2]]`

IF "Product Image Name" CONTAINS "main"
- SET image to Position 0 (i.e. Make it equal to: Item Image(Primary Information > Field ID: custitem_atlas_item_image) && Image URL 1(Shopify > Required > Field ID: custitem_nsc_shopify_image_url_1))
AND 
- SET 10001_1.jpg to array position 1 (Image URL 2)
- SET 10001_2.jpg to array position 2 (Image URL 3)



Since we are on the relative subject of further automating inventory items; there are a couple Shopify fields our team would like simplified, if possible.

1. Product Description (Shopify>Required >Field ID: custitem_nsc_shopify_prod_desc)
2. Shopify Product Collections (Shopify>Required >Field ID: custitem_nsc_shopify_prod_collections)
