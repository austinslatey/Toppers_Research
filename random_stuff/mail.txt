Gimena,
You should have access to NetSuite now and should have gotten an email to set up your password (production)
Our product list is extensive, so it would be ideal to have our folder structure sorted by Vendor

Currently, a folder inside of our NetSuite folder system (File Cabinet > Vendor Files) which contains a series of Vendor-Named Folders. 
Within the Vendor-Named folders, a series of product-sku named folders contain publicly accessible images. 
Naming Conventions of the images don't necessiarily follow a strict pattern, besides the image name starting with the product SKU and are ordered numerically besides the main image.

Generally, the product's images names follow a relative structure of:
/VendorFiles/FirstExampleVendorName/
- 10001_main.jpg
- 10001_1.jpg
- 10001_2.jpg

If the images' naming convention needs to follow a strict pattern to have the script accept them, please let us know, and moving forward we will begin to name all images as such.

Variations of the generic product's image naming conventions can include but are not limited to:
- 10001_ExampleVendorName_main.jpg
- 10001_ExampleVendorName_1.jpg
- 10001_ExampleVendorName_2.jpg
| --------- OTHER VARIATION --------- |
- 10001_ExampleVendorName_Waldoch_main.jpg
- 10001_ExampleVendorName_Waldoch_1.jpg
- 10001_ExampleVendorName_Waldoch_2.jpg
| --------- OTHER VARIATION --------- |
- 10001.jpg
- 10001_1.jpg
- 10001_2.jpg


Regarding scripting, it should be easy enough to iterate through the image names
`[[10001_main.jpg, 10001_1.jpg, 10001_2.jpg], [0, 1, 2]]`

IF "Product Image Name" CONTAINS "main"
- SET image to Position 0 (i.e. Make it equal to: Item Image(Primary Information > Field ID: custitem_atlas_item_image) && Image URL 1(Shopify > Required > Field ID: custitem_nsc_shopify_image_url_1))
AND 
- SET 10001_1.jpg to array position 1 (Image URL 2)
- SET 10001_2.jpg to array position 2 (Image URL 3)



Since we are on the relative subject of further automating inventory items; there are a couple Shopify fields our team would like simplified, if possible.

1. Product Description (Shopify>Required >Field ID: custitem_nsc_shopify_prod_desc)
2. Shopify Product Collections (Shopify>Required >Field ID: custitem_nsc_shopify_prod_collections)

Product Description Problem:
Say an employee inserts plain text into this field, once the product is updated inside Shopify, it does not convert the text into a well structured text document.
When an employee has to input data into this field, for it to be formatted nicely on Shopify they have to input the description as HTML.

Is there a way to convert plain text into something that Shopify can read as markup?

Plain Text Example:
```
Product Description
    This is a product description, but
    A new line in the product description should indicate a line break

Unordered list Heading
    - Some detail about the Unordered List
    - Some detail about the Unordered List

Ordered list Heading
    1. Some detail about the Ordered List
    2. Some detail about the Ordered List

*The Astric usually indicates Italic Text*
Another *Variation* of Italic

**Two Astrics usually indicates Bold Text**
Another **Variation** of Bold Text

```

Shopify allows plain text but it seems every new line is simply a semantic <p> tag in HTML
DESIRED HTML CONVERSION:
```
<h2>Product Description</h2>
<p>This is a product description, but</p>
<p>A new line in the product description should indicate a line break</p>

<h3>Unordered list Heading</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Some detail about the Unordered List</li>
    <li>Some detail about the Unordered List</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ordered list Heading</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some detail about the Ordered List</li>
    <li>Some detail about the Ordered List</li>
</ol>

<p><i>The Astric usually indicates Italic Text</i></p>
<p>Another <i>Variation</i> of Italic</p>

<p><strong>Two Astrics usually indicates Bold Text</strong></p>
<p>Another<strong>Variation</strong> of Bold Text</p>
```
